<!-- 
Name of App is WikiFoodia
- An app which takes some user input, CRUD ( users can add ingredients and create recipes out of added ingredients)
- user can search for recipes based on column opitons
- columns would include name of meal, description, ingredients, prep time, caloric content, number of servings,cooking instruction, images of meal,
- flavors of the week will be included in the index page in a card
- Animate some data on the front end? Maybe use apis to pull in some recipes.
- User table to give CRUD security
- Search table to enable search for meals by column
- one table for recipes(B, L, D, Des) and one column for recipe type. Could have a user recipe table to show which user owns inputed recipe, recipe type table could be a look up table with two colums; id and recipe type.
- users would answer security question
- ingredient list could be an array joined with a splitter which creates a string to be stored in the database
- description would be plain text
