Start cooking the shaki first with as little water as possible (see video below) as it is the toughest meat in the bunch. This soup should have as little water as possible so add small amounts of water at a time and top it up as you cook.
When the shaki starts to curl, add the dry fish and stockfish.

"PREPARATION:
Step 1
Prepare the Chicharrones: Place pork belly on a rimmed baking sheet. Stir together salt, sugar and cumin; rub evenly on pork. Wrap pork in plastic wrap, and chill 6 to 12 hours.
Step 2
Preheat oven to 425°F. Unwrap pork, and place, fat side up, on a lightly greased wire rack. Place rack in a rimmed baking sheet, and bake until golden brown and crispy, about 30 minutes.
Step 3
Reduce oven temperature to 250°F, and cook until pork is tender when pierced with a fork, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.
Step 4
Cool to room temperature, about 45 minutes. Wrap pork in plastic wrap, and chill until firm, at least 1 hour.
Step 5
Cut pork into 4 strips. Cut 3/4-inch deep slits crosswise in pork at 1-inch intervals. Heat a large skillet over medium. Cook pork until golden brown and crispy, about 4 minutes per side.
Step 6
Prepare the Hogao: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium. Add onions, bell pepper, and achiote paste; cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 8 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, garlic, cumin, and salt. Cook, stirring often, until tomatoes have broken down and thickened, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in cilantro.
Step 7
Prepare the Frijoles Rojos: Place beans in a medium bowl; add water to cover by at least 2 inches. Cover and let stand overnight at room temperature.
Step 8
Drain beans. Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-low. Add pork belly; cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 8 minutes. Stir in beans, broth, Hogao, cumin, and salt. Increase heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until beans are tender, 4 hours and 30 minutes to 5 hours, adding water, 1 cup at a time, if mixture becomes too thick.
Step 9
Prepare the Carne Molida: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add beef; cook, stirring to break into pieces, until browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in Hogao, salt, and cumin; cook, stirring often, until well combined and heated through, about 2 minutes.
Step 10
Prepare the Chorizo: Heat oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium. Cook chorizo links, turning occasionally, until lightly charred and cooked through, about 15 minutes.
Step 11
Prepare the Arepas: Combine masarepa, cheese, water, salt, and 1 tablespoon of the oil in a medium bowl. Stir with a wooden spoon until dough is smooth. (Dough will look soupy, but will firm up after standing.) Cover and let stand 10 minutes.
Step 12
Shape dough into 4 (4-ounce) balls. Gently flatten each into a 1/2-inch-thick disk (about 3 1/2 inches in diameter). Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium. Cook arepas until golden brown and charred in spots, about 5 minutes per side.
Step 13
Prepare the Tajadas de Plátano: Cut plantains diagonally into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium. Cook plantains, in batches, until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels, and sprinkle with salt.
Step 14
Prepare the Huevos Fritos: Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium. Break eggs into pan, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook until whites are set and starting to brown around edges, 4 to 5 minutes.

"PREPARATION: 
To prepare the dough:Place the masarepa in a large bowl. Add the sazon Goya and salt and stir to mix well. Add the water and oil and mix to form dough. Pat the dough into a ball and knead for 2 minutes or until smooth. Cover with plastic and set aside for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, to make the filling, cook the potatoes in a pot with water and the bouillon tablet for 20-25 minutes or until tender. Drain and gently mash the potatoes. Set aside.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, heavy skillet. Add the onion and cook over medium-low heat stirring frequently, for 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, green onions, garlic, bell pepper, cilantro, salt and black pepper. Cook for about 15 minutes.
Add the ground pork and beef. Cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, for 10 to 15 minutes or until the mixture is fairly dry.
Transfer the meat mixture to the mashed potatoes bowl and mix well to combine.
Break small portions of the dough, about 1 ½ tablespoons each one, and form each portion into a ball by rolling between the palms of your hands.
Place the balls of dough between two pieces of plastic and roll each out very thinly to form a circle. Remove the top plastic and place 1 tablespoon of the filling in the center of each.
Then using the plastic underneath, fold the dough over to enclose the filling, forming a half circle. Tightly seal the edges by crimping with the tines of a fork.
Fill a large pot with vegetable oil and heat over medium heat to 360° F.
Carefully place 3 or 4 empanadas at the time in the heated oil and fry for about 2 minutes until golden on all sides.
Using a slotted spoon transfer the empanadas to a plate lined with paper towels. Serve with ají and lime on the side.",
